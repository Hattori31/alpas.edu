                   <p>MANILA - On Thursday, President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. requested an update on the implementation of the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) Registration Act, also known as Republic Act (RA) 11934.

                    In the State Dining Room of Malacaan Palace, Marcos called a meeting with representatives of the Private Sector Advisory Council (PSAC), according to a Facebook post by state-run Radio Television Malacaang (RTVM).
                    
                    According to Republic Act No. 11934, popularly known as the SIM Card Registration Act, "The President also requests reporting on the ongoing registration of subscriber identity module (SIM) cards."
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The first piece of legislation Marcos signed, RA 11934, governs the use of SIM cards by requiring all end users to register their mobile phone numbers.

                    Beginning on December 27, 2022, the 180-day registration period may be extended by an additional 120 days if necessary.
                    
                    According to the law, all current SIM subscribers must submit a completed form via a database platform or website offered by the telecommunications companies within 180 days after receiving it.
                    
                    After six months, phone numbers that are not registered are terminated.

                    <b>Digital infrastructure work plan</b><br><br>
                    Marcos examined the PSAC's digital infrastructure work plan during the meeting at Malacaan Palace.

                    According to the RTVM, the meeting's main topic was "future plans in developing the country's digital infrastructure."

                    "The Chief Executive analyzes the Digital Infrastructure Work Plan provided by the PSAC members during the meeting," it continued.

                    According to the RTVM, Marcos also spoke with representatives from the Philippine Statistics Authority, the National Economic and Development Authority, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Information and Communications Technology, and the Anti-Red Tape Authority about the proposed digital infrastructure.

                    Marcos has made achieving nationwide connectivity one of his top priorities.

                    Marcos established the PSAC, which is led by Saibin Aboitiz, President and CEO of the Aboitiz Group, to improve coordination and collaboration between the public and private sectors. (PNA)
