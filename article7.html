                   <p>
                    The recent 2023 Global Risks Report of the World Economic Forum identified the cost-of-living crisis as the most severe 
                    global risk coming in the next two years, amid the inflationary pressures and the global supply chain disruptions caused 
                    by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.<br><br>
                    Alarmingly, a prolonged cost-of-living crisis threatens to further widen the inequality gap in society, which was already
                    worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic.This
                    looming socio-economic threat may ultimately lead to social unrest and political 
                    instability.<br><br> In the case of the Philippines, headline inflation accelerated to 8.1% in December 2022, the highest 
                    since November 2008. This brought the average inflation rate for 2022 to 5.8%, which was substantially higher than the 3.9%
                    recorded in the previous year.<br><br> There is no doubt that the Philippines needs to be resilient from risks that both emanate
                    internally and externally An opportunity arises with its eventual participation in the free trade agreement (FTA) called the 
                    Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). <br><Br> Signed in November 2020, the RCEP aims to deepen economic integration
                    in the region and strengthen the economic partnership among participating nations, which could ultimately generate more jobs and 
                    employment opportunities, as well as to improve people’s standard of living and overall welfare.<br><br>
                    Signatories to this free trade agreement were the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as well
                    as South Korea, China, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.<br> The Philippines and Myanmar have yet to ratify the RCEP. While the RCEP
                    was ratified by then Philippine President Rodrigo Roa Duterte in September 2021, it has yet to be ratified by the Senate over concerns
                    of protecting the country’s agriculture sector.<br>On paper, the ratification of the RCEP could contribute to ramping up the economic
                    recovery of member states as it aims to strengthen their relations through greater trade and investment. After all, collaboration is key
                    to move forward together.<br> In the case of the Philippines, the RCEP could open more opportunities for a bigger market for its exports,
                    which could help narrow the country’s persistent trade deficit.<br><br>Unnecessary delay in the Philippines’ involvement in the RCEP will
                    result in the country missing many important opportunities for growth and in mitigating the risks of a looming global crisis in cost of living. Hence, there is no better time to call for immediate collective action than now, before we get shut out and again left behind by competing economies.
