                    MANILA – When the South Korean band returned to the Philippines for a show, Filipino fans finally got The Rose again.
                    Woosung, Hajun, Dojun, and Jaehyun sang Black Rose at the 'Heal Together' concert held at SM North EDSA Skydome in Quezon City on January 14th.

                   <p>
                    The band sang constantly for nearly two hours, singing songs from "Heal," the group's first full-length album, which was published last October, as well as other previously released hits. 
                    The Rose began the night with the melancholy songs "Definition of Ugly is," "Insomnia," and "She's in the Rain," and then the set selection evolved to gradually "heal" fans to a state of catharsis when the band sang 
                    about the bitterness of heartbreak in the pop-rock "Sour" to close the show.
                    <p>
                        In addition to fan favorites like as "Sorry," "RED," and "Cure," the group also performed "Modern Life" from Woosung's solo project "Moth."
                        One of the night's highlights was a fun interaction in which the band, lead by Dojoon, encouraged ansf to sing "Yes" in relay. After a few tries, the crowd succeeded.

                    “Thank you, guys. You are so heartwarming, and very enthusiastic and energetic,” Dojoon said. 
                    Throughout the show, the members expressed how much they missed the energetic Filipino crowd, which Woosung described as "the loudest in Southeast Asia." The Rose last performed in Manila in December 2019 
                    and was one of the last Korean acts to perform in the country before the COVID-19 pandemic halted live shows worldwide.
                    “When we come back next year, are you guys going to be here?” Woosung asked. “We missed you so much. The Rose’s hearts are 'sour' without you,” he continued, referencing one of their songs. 
                    The Rose concluded the evening with a photo session and the distribution of red roses to the crowd.
