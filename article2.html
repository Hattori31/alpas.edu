                   <p>The more difficult things grow, the more determined Olympic gold medallist Hidilyn Diaz-Naranjo becomes.
                    The Filipino weightlifting celebrity didn't even bat an eyelid in response.
                    “I love being challenged. This year I’ll become more disciplined and determined to win back-to-back gold medals in the Olympics for our country,’’ said Diaz-Naranjo, who will move up to the women’s 59 kilograms for her second straight golden bid.The weight class will be new ground for the four-time Olympian, who won the country's first gold medal in Summer Games history when she won the 55-kg event in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. However, the weight class in which Diaz-Naranjo had previously won in key events was removed from the schedule of the 2024 Paris Olympics, prompting the Filipino star to move up in pursuit of an encore.<br>

                    She acknowledged that in order to make the move, she would need to have a muscular frame that could support more force.“I need to be more focused while training to meet 59 kg. I expect training will be much harder as I work on my diet. Rest will also be important to prevent injuries,’’ said Diaz-Naranjo.In her search, the 31-year-old Zamboanga City resident won't be acting alone.Along with the rest of Team HD—sports psychologist Karen Trinidad, nutritionist Jeanette Aro, and assistant Rowel Garcia—Diaz-Naranjo will be advised along the road by her husband and head coach Julius Naranjo.If there is one advantage she could use, it is that Diaz-Naranjo has seen all of her potential competitors in Paris.<br><br>
                    
                    “I saw how they played in the world championships, their technique and how they prepared themselves. I’m confident that I can do it,’’ said Diaz-Naranjo, who finally snatched the missing diadem in her collection by winning the 55-kg division in the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) World Championships in Colombia.
                    “I will not go there just to compete. My goal is to become the best lifter in these tournaments,’’ said Diaz-Naranjo, who visited Philippine Sports Commission Chair Richard Bachmann early this week.
                    “That will be my mindset all the way to the Paris.’’
